{"selftext":"Every now and then there are google sheets templates posted on the sub, however most of them are unnecessarily complicated or simply visually exhausting to use. Over the past year or so, I've built and improved on a budget sheet I've started from scratch. It has 8 sheets covering everything from daily spendings to monthly overview, savings and even a 10 year wealth growth plan.\n\nIt has helped me immensely and I'm thinking that it could be a great start for some of the readers here. So I'm just wondering if there is anyone out there that would be interested in getting hold of the template. If so, I will look into making a copy of my own file and emptying it out. Keep in mind that I live in an European Country and made the layout according to this. However I think it could easily be made to use with any currency.  \n\n**edit #1:** quick preview of what's to [come] (https:\/\/imgur.com\/52PnXm5) : monthly overview of all your expenses and savings gathered in one place, grouped in months. \n\n**edit #2:** thanks for the interest guys. here's sheet 2: \"[varied](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/lW0rf)\" - to be used for daily spendings and subscriptions.  the changes here reflect on the monthly sheet. \n\n**edit #3:** loving the feedback \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb i'm updating and fixing things as i go. thanks to u\/Sparksterrr's comment, the monthly overview now is organized better. the expense box now exclude savings, and they are listed after the expenses field, on a seperate box. as seen [here](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/mGmpT). the third sheet is the \"quota\" sheet. this is an independent sheet to be used for determining monthly quotas for your varied and extra expenses. [here it is](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/9Y462). \n\n**edit #4:** here's the fourth sheet: savings overview - very simple table that shows your monthly savings growth. the sheet changes accordingly to your input to the saving box at the monthly overview. simple stacked chart on the side shows your growth. [check it out.](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/yICiB)\n\nalso, it's friday night around here, so no updates for a while :) do keep the feedback coming though!\n\n**edit #5:** fifth sheet: trip budgets. this is another independent sheet, meaning that changes made here won't affect the overview. you can choose to reference the final amount in a particular month if you wish to. [sheet 5](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/bt8LU). \n\n**edit #6:** last sheet and the grand finale: net worth. i decided to cut 2 sheets off for now, in order to be able to finish the whole template. the last sheet is a very new addition, inspired from J.L. Collins' great book 'The Simple Path to Wealth'. It is a yearly overview of your income, expenses and savings along with a 12 year growth plan. [the 6th sheet](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/4KBCU)\n\nit's pretty late over here so im off to get some sleep. the work is mostly done, so hopefully by tomorrow noon (in about 11 hours) the template is up for grabs \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\n**TEMPLATE:** So here comes the real deal. [the template] (https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1a0Gr6OEkxZTdhsVPyNVBLCJbSN8dsZc2t-7VT_MNu-w\/edit?usp=sharing)\nstill working on fixing the small errors, so bear with me. if you notice anything strange just holla at me and i'll get on it. otherwise, hope you guys find it useful \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n\n**HOW TO:** A bit of general explanation on the whole thing. the overview sheet is your main view, where you will be entering some of the bigger data. the next most used one will be varied sheet, for the daily spendings. the other ones are either tracking or calculation. in general, any blue text means it is linked to somewhere and shouldn't be changed. green text is where you input data so that the rest of the calculation can work. other than that, make sure to read the comments on the template, and you should be fine!","sentiment":"positive"}

I know I signed for about 35k in loans from Great Lakes which was fine cause I knew that would be feasible to pay off but I found out between my mom and dad they signed for 60k in parent plus loans which puts my loans at ~95k. They didn't want me to going to public school, community college or the military because I would end up \"fucking up\". Me personally I would of went to a cheaper school or went to community college for the first two years..... but I guess that's the lesson learned for letting someone handle my finances instead of myself.

From what they told me, they basically have me stop paying my credit cards. After a few months of collecting 230 bucks from me a month, they will negotiate paying the debt in full on my defaulted loans. It obviously tanks your credit, but probably so does having credit cards you'll never pay off. I'm in $11,000 of credit card debt, 3 cards total. They are telling me they will withdraw $230 a month for 36 months. Ultimately they are going to negotiate my loans down to $7,000 something, and they're paying themselves a thousand something.

{"selftext":"Here's the timeline of events.  I know now that I should've been pulling a credit report every four months, but that ship has sailed.  I also know now, three times over, the importance of having enforceable professionally-written partnership agreements.  Hopefully others will learn from my mistakes.\n\n1) Bought a house in 2006 with an ex-girlfriend; I was 22\/yo and naive.  The idea was to let her live there while we flipped it, but she moved in and refused to move out or to pay me any rent.  However, she paid the two mortgages reliably until 2014.  Because it was financed at 100% LTV, I didn't have much tied up in it and it helped build my credit at the time, so that was deemed acceptable.\n\n2) Years later I found myself in a financially distressed position because a different partner in a separate investment wasn't making cash calls and I'd taken up the slack.  This was post-financial-crisis, I had lost my job, was burning through savings mostly to fund the investment, and everything looked very bleak.  I quit-claimed the deed to the house to the ex-GF for her to return my investment in it dollar-for-dollar and with the idea that it could protect her from collectors or my personal bankruptcy later on...although that was narrowly avoided.  We agreed that she would refinance when banks started lending again, but she never did that and I had no means to compel her to do so.  She subsequently ruined her own credit, making that an impossibility.\n\n3) She stopped paying in 2014 and the lenders began selling notes to third-party special servicers.  Foreclosures were initiated once in 2016 and again in Spring 2017, with her making sporadic efforts to stave it off.  The second one prompted her to sell the house, and it sold just in the nick of time.  The primary mortgage is reflected as paid in full and has an OK status, but the second mortgage indicates LMN for loan modification and then C\/O at the end for a charge-off.  It appears that $211 was unpaid for some reason.\n\n4) Throughout this process, I remained on the mortgage, the banks had my correct contact information and that information was also reflected on my credit report, but nobody made any effort to inform me or to collect money from me.  That was a grave error.  I would've been able at that point to make a deal and get everybody sorted out early on.\n\nBut here I am.\n\nNow I have a daughter who will start Kindergarten in 2019, and my wife and I have the goal in mind to buy a house by that time so that we won't be itinerant after that.  My wife is a brand new immigrant.  I am following the \/r\/personalfinance PRIME DIRECTIVE with her to build her credit score from nothing, but I am concerned that my own past is going to interfere with our plans.  I have several questions:\n\nA) How much less worse is a foreclosure that was begun than a foreclosure that was concluded?  Can I dig my way out of this in less than seven years?  Does having had it happen multiple times make a difference?  What about the modification and charge-off?\n\nB) Does it matter at all that nobody attempted to collect money from me?  Is there some way that I can attempt to repair credit on that basis?\n\nC) I have heard that the credit score on a foreclosure is only impacted to the date of first delinquency, which would be in 2014.  But is that necessarily true in my case, with the loans having been sold between servicers, with modifications, with multiple foreclosures, and with the charge-off?\n\n[sigh]  Such a mess...

This is a highly liquid fund with tight spreads and low ownership costs, making it a good choice for both long- and short-term investors who want exposure to markets outside of North America.\"\n\nI'm intrigued by the higher growth, inclusion of small caps, and also because of the high investments in Japan, where I live.\n\nWhat about either doing a 4-fund portfolio, or swapping out VXUS for IEFA?\n\nThanks.\n\n","sentiment":"positive"}

An extraordinary claim that Ramsey declines to even try to present evidence for, being content to point out lots of ways credit cards could hurt people when misused and leave it at that. \n\n[Alright, it actually doesn\u2019t look like this article was written by Ramsey himself, but I\u2019m still taking it as representative of his views, it\u2019s on his site and linked to by many other posts.]\n\nEarly on, the article anticipates the objection \"I can pay my credit card off each month. So what\u2019s the big deal?\" and counters with \u201cThere is no positive side to credit card use. Even by paying the bill on time, you\u2019re not beating the system.\u201d And then goes into talking about how much credit card debt the average family carries and something about \u201cyou\u2019re likely to pay thousands of dollars in interest over the years as you carry a balance.\u201d What does this have to do with the person saying they can pay off their card each month? This bit is a total non-sequitur. The next sentence returns to the possibility of paying the card in full, and we\u2019re informed that with one missed payment \u201cyour interest rate skyrockets, you get slapped with fees and it dings your credit.\u201d Come on. Interest rate doesn\u2019t matter if you never carry a balance, and Ramsey and Co. don\u2019t believe credit scores matter (says so later in this article.) So that just leaves fees, but electric bills and rent also have fees for late\/missed payments. Adults need to learn to pay bills reliably. This isn\u2019t an argument against anything. \n\nThe next bit about cash-back cards is less an argument, than a shitty attempt at a gotcha. It\u2019s basically: \u201cYou think you\u2019re getting this money back, but what about the fees you\u2019re paying? Bet you never thought of that ever!\u201d And if you don\u2019t pay annual fees, this means basically nothing. Look, I don\u2019t doubt there are people in this situation, not realizing they\u2019re getting ripped off\u2026 but this isn\u2019t an argument against credit cards, it\u2019s an argument for doing some really freaking simple math before getting one that has a fee. As for rewards in the form of miles, I avoid them myself because it\u2019s less immediately obvious how much what I\u2019m getting back is worth. And I\u2019m afraid travel-specific rewards would incentivize me to take more trips than I should, rather than cash-back which goes into my regular money pool. However! I\u2019m not assuming every person using them is enough of a dullard to not know what they\u2019re getting. Once again, the writer demonstrates that misuse exists (or rather, that misuse is possible) and believes that supports the claim that responsible use doesn\u2019t exist. \n\nI\u2019ll admit, the bit about credit cards making you spend more is a little fuzzier. Personally, I can demonstrate that I\u2019m paying nothing in interest or fees. I can\u2019t conclusively prove that I\u2019m not spending more than I would with cash or debit only. But I will say the bolded admonition that **\u201cYou\u00a0will\u00a0spend more if you use credit cards.\u201d** is without support. The evidence that this is even a trend on average is IMO somewhat questionable, but the evidence that this is in effect for every person without fail is non-existent. The article confidently assets that \u201cWhen you pay cash, you can feel the money leaving your hand,\u201d and that \u201cFlipping a credit card up on a counter does nothing to you emotionally,\u201d which is an extreme oversimplification of the issue. And if it were true that simple, then immediately recommending debit in place of credit makes no sense. Wouldn\u2019t flipping a debit card on the counter also do nothing to me emotionally?\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading. Again, I know this advice isn\u2019t for me, but I still believe it could do good for more people if Ramsey learned some nuance and stopped mixing crappy logic and baseless assertions in with the legitimate stuff.\n\n**Edit: I\u2019m an idiot and kept saying \u201cin the linked article\u201d when I hadn\u2019t actually liked it. So, uh, here you go.** https:\/\/www.daveramsey.com\/blog\/the-truth-about-credit-card-debt","sentiment":"negative"}

At about 18% interest rate there's still about 17,000 outstanding. Since the loans taken out (2 for 15k) we're for improvements to the house I guess they can put a lien on the house which is why I say I would be inheriting debt. Other than just paying the $17,000 off to avoid paying these ridiculous interest rates what are my other options? If they would settle for a certain amount of cents to the dollar to payoff the loan how do I go about negotiating that and for what amount?

Thank you for taking the time to read my post.\n\nA little back story: I'm a younger single mom, working full-time, receiving a small amount of help from the father of my lovely (and crazy) three year old. \n\nThe past two years has been filled with personal, emotional, and financial ups and downs, but mainly downs. I was left by a roommate to pay for an apartment that we both knew I couldn't afford; lost two cars in accidents because I can't afford a car payment, so I bought what I could afford with the insurance payouts; took out personal loan after personal loan (which now I realize I shouldn't have done), and now I'm left in the aftermath of everything.. I moved from the expensive apartment to a reasonably priced studio for my area, have been staying \"on time\" with payments but only because I have overdraft on my checking account which leaves me paying for my payment plus $34 with every overdraft.. I've been selling my clothes and shoes online to try to make extra cash, work overtime when I can.... I'm still struggling to put food on the table (figuratively speaking.. my mom has been buying my son's food for the past 3 months, and I opt for cans of soup and bags of lettuce). Everything else she gets is for him. \n\nI'm at a point where I cry myself to sleep at least 3 times a week; cry in the bathrooms at work because it's the only place I can be where my son doesn't see my cry; I find myself looking over my income and bills at least twice a week, again just feeling defeated. \n\nI don't know what to do, how to get myself out of this 10 foot hole I've dug myself into, where do I start?

{"selftext":"A little background, I have, as of 5 minutes ago, just over 79k in student loan debt. Up until last May, I was paying about $184\/mo on an IBR plan. I decided that I wanted to try and bring that number down because I came into a little money that allowed me to pay off my car, my wife's engagement ring, and a couple of credit cards. Since May, I've been paying about $834\/mo, the full repayment amount. I've probably been able to get the number down about $2,000 in the last 5 months. I'm at my wit's end here. I'm paying almost a second mortgage for these student loans and the damn number isn't moving. It's really starting to cut into my savings, the money left over that I came into, mentioned above. I have a total 9 loans, most of which are fixed at between 6%-6.8% interest. The three others are fixed at 4.5%, 5.41%, and 5.6% respectively. \n\nI feel like if I go back on IBR, the interest is going to kill me and the number is going to keep going up. I haven't defaulted on any of my loans, they're in good standing. It really tears me down when the original principal on one loan is like $3,600 and the unpaid principal now $5,300. Others look worse, few look better.\n\nI'm a third year teacher, but not in an inner-city or Title 1 school. I spent one year at a Title 1 school, but was offered a job at a wonderful Charter school. I'm just not sure of my options at this point. I know I qualify for some kind of forgiveness after 5 years in a Title 1 school, but I'm not going to end up hitting that. I don't necessarily trust, or maybe it's that I don't completely understand, all of the information I've received from the place that bought my FAFSA loans from the government. \n\nSo, I guess I'm asking what my best course of option is here. I remember some years ago hearing that paying 10 years on loans, no matter what the minimum due balance is, will forgive the remainder of the loan, but I feel that's not the case anymore. If that is still the case, then IBR is the whole answer. I just don't want to end up paying this crap for the rest of my life. ","sentiment":"negative"}

I called Comcast, which was no help really, but she confirmed the bill was in collections and they would not remove the late notice, even if we paid.  So I remembered on here that there may be an option to have a Pay for Delete, Comcast said they could not do that and that was it, but they were willing to take my payment.   So, I read that its best to settle with the OC, so you have documentation to show the collection agency (should they come around) that the debt was cleared and to pull any of their negative reports etc.  I still have to look to see if it was Comcast or the collection agency that posted the bad remark.\n\n\nAny advice?

I posted this just before bed and woke up to an exploded post with lots of different opinions to listen to. The two big takeaways I have from this are 1) Educate myself on finances before I make a decision and 2) keep doing what I'm doing and save money. It's really important to me to have financial independence and the freedom that brings, so I'm trying to take charge of what my money does. Now to address the advice I've gotten:\n\nAfter a bit more research I may put it in an IRA like many have recommended. I agree that I should be looking for the best way to invest rather than the fastest way to make money. I'll definitely keep at least half of my savings for a rainy day fund. Ive gotten some PMs about book recommendations, which I really appreciate. I'll be heading to the local library soon. Cryptocurrency is interesting to me since I'm a CS major, but I won't view that seriously as an investment since I don't fully understand it yet. I may take a couple hundred dollars and play around with it, though. I will also be looking into Vanguard because that was mentioned a lot, too.\n\nThank you all for taking the time to give me important advice.

We weren't really ready to start looking but wanted a ballpark of what we could afford so we could know how much more we wanted to save. We both have good, stable jobs and make \"a lot of money for first time homebuyers in this area\" according to our mortgage broker. We had a ton of student loan debt and a huge debt-to-income ratio, so we were pre-approved for the lower end of what we would want in our area, which is a ridiculously hot sellers' market (like many places right now). Despite that, we feel comfortable with buying at that price point and are now ready to start looking. \n\nSeveral months ago, my husband's parents generously paid off a huge chunk of his student loans.

I thought I could make my payments on time and in full until a few bad decisions ran up the amount needed to pay off became too much to bear.

Now they will not release my car to me until I pay off the citations as well as the towing fee, which totals out to $376. I only possess about $200 at the moment and have no idea on how to continue forward without begging family members for any amount of money, which I truly want to avoid because they already provide me so much for various other expenses that a college regularly accumulate.

I work on campaigns and if I had stayed, it would have been tougher for me to get another job for awhile longer.\n\nThe bad news is-- I'm now stuck with an apartment that I can't afford in a place I don't really want to live, a car that is significantly over-under by about $4-5k, and $12k in credit card debt. Most of the jobs I'm looking at are thinking a December-January hiring date, and if I stick around the DC area (which is what I'm thinking), I won't get as much money and my dollar won't go as far.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* ***How can I get out of a 12 month lease?*** I really thought that I had hit it big with this job. Great income (a ton of money a month), enough for me to easily afford a nice place to live, a good car, and easily enough left over to drop off that credit card debt within 3-4 months. Now, I'm not so sure. I'm stuck in this apartment-- there's a sub-let agreement that i can sign, but I have to pay a fee that's equivalent to a month's (very expensive) rent and it's not guaranteed that they'll find someone right away. Or I can buy it out, but the buy-out clause costs over $5-6k-- not realistic.\n\n* ***How to sell my car?*** I've got a 2016 car with about 35k miles on it. Would have been perfect for this job, but I don't need it if I stick around the DC area with metro. I'd love to get the debt off my conscious and not have to worry about the $385 monthly car payments that I'm making right now. Is it possible to sell a car over-under? I read the guide but I just don't know what kind of personal loan I could possibly hope for right now as my credit rating is starting to tank (I'm down to a 710 now from a 760 earlier in the year).\n\n* ***Is it worth liquidating some of my Roth IRA to pay these debts?*** I have about 9.5k sitting in a Roth right now-- I could use that to help the over-under and help pay down the debts, but everything that I've seen and commonsense tells me to keep that where it is.\n\nMy folks can help me cover rent for this month, and that's about it-- I also filed for unemployment.

When I discovered PF, it was so addicting because of the sheer amount of information. Seeing what people have done, how they\u2019ve done it, learning how to comb through all that is finance and pulling out only what\u2019s important was amazing. \n\nSo once I learned how much to save for retirement, why you only need so much cash and how saving\/investing is important (even if it\u2019s small) while you also pay off debt, I was hooked. \n\nI kept within my range and boom, all of a sudden I\u2019m debt free. But what\u2019s important is how I\u2019m still following those habits, now I simply  put more into retirement, plan to save for larger things or experiences and still know the value of money. I did not get out of debt and completely forget everything.\n\n**2) Use your time in debt to learn what\u2019s important to you.**\n\nThis may sound like a surprise but this may be the most important thing I learned. We all want to get out of debt as quickly as possible and go through that door that is \u201cdebt free.\u201d The problem is, you don\u2019t want to walk through that door and look back and regret missing out on anything, especially in your 20s.\n\nThis is also the most controversial\/unsettled topic on this sub. \u201cHow much can I spend on social?\u201d \u201cAm I allowed to travel?\u201d \u201cWhat should I allocate to personal expenses?\u201d\n\nIn my experience, you have to LIVE. This in and of itself is subjective but I\u2019d argue the fundamental question is \u201cWhat gives me fulfillment?\u201d\n\nNo-one can answer this except yourself and there is NO wrong answer. If living in a nice place is important - FINE. If traveling is important - FINE. If playing golf every weekend is important \u2014 FINE. If having nice clothes is important \u2014 FINE. \n\nWhat YOU need to decipher is WHICH thing is MOST important. You cannot have it all, you can\u2019t. But you CAN live in a shithole and travel. You can live in a nice place and stay in more often. You can indulge in nights out while sacrificing a decent car.\n\nI\u2019d argue that this sub expects everyone to cut back on EVERYTHING. We can\u2019t all live at our parent\u2019s home, bike to work, not go out\/travel and just casually get through debt. (I know that\u2019s a massive generalization, but you get the point).\n\nWhich gets to the next point\u2026\n\n**3) You are human.**\n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one here who cooks their meals for the week, keeps a budget, brews their own coffee, watches tracks every penny and gets anxiety when they go over their budget. This is no way to live. First of all, you should be proud to be so cognizant of your financial situation, most people aren\u2019t. Secondly, life is messy, random. We have moments that are unexpected, we have desires that come out of nowhere, we discover wants that speak to us. None of this is bad, it\u2019s what makes us human and I\u2019ll be the first to admit how much anxiety this has caused me in the past 5 years. \n\nI live in Chicago and work in the creative industry \u2014 the least friendly financial space with spending. I can\u2019t even count how many weeks I was doing so well following my budget and the weekend would hit and a night out or brunch would take me over $20, $40 or $100. Just in time for Sunday with all other worries washing over me, I was a mess. Frustrated and full of regret, I\u2019d be so mad to fall off track. I look back now on how dumb that was to waste all that mental capacity on worrying and plus, those were the nights with friends that I\u2019ll remember Chicago for. Well, the nights where I didn\u2019t drink too much\u2026 : ) \n\nYou need to have a life and you cannot remove the moments from life that make it so interesting. Use your budget BUT I\u2019d argue you should allow it to flex\/bend\/adapt, we are not perfect.\n\n\n**4) Consider PF a Training Ground**\n\nThis subreddit is fantastic as I\u2019ve already mentioned but I\u2019d caution against treating it as a regular destination once you\u2019ve gotten your PF situation in order. A lot of finance is simply being aware of income vs costs\/wants and it gets to a point where you have to use your own judgement as you move forward. I see a lot of people here so quickly reprimand others for not putting enough away for retirement or paying too much for a home. While these comments can be valid, remember that individuals and their stories are wildly different. A salary of $85,000 is vastly different for an individual with no debt as opposed to a parent with three kids and a mortgage. Neither person is right or wrong per se in their endeavors, it\u2019s simply where they are in life. The last thing we need to do on this sub is criticize people for the situations they\u2019re already in.\n\n\n\n**Financial Breakdown**\n\nI will try to be as concise as possible but I really do not have every detail from Day 1 of paying off my loans so I\u2019ll do my best. I work in the creative industry in Chicago, 30\/M. I also have a doc that I developed but will share that in another post as that requires a lot of explaining.\n\n**Background**\n\n**Spring 2009 (22)**: Graduated undergrad with a bachelors in Video Production, a minor in Business and a Sales Certificate. I was fortunate to have no debt, thanks to my parents paying the way.\n\n**Spring 2009 - Fall 2010**: Work at a small production agency making $10\/hour. Live at home, leasing a car. Decide I need to attend a portfolio school (small art school focusing on either art direction\/design\/photography\/interactive and building a book of \u201cfake\u201d work) to have a better career with more visual skills. I focus on design and art direction to pair with my video background. \n\n**Fall 2010 - Fall 2012**: Begin portfolio school. About $10K saved but have to take out government loans and borrow from parents. I occasionally freelance as well while in school. School is 2 years straight though, no breaks. Live in some shitholes and really don\u2019t spend any money except one night a week at a shitty local bar everyone goes to. \n\n**Total after graduating: ~ $43K in loans ($33k\/gov at 5% | $10K\/parents at 0%)**\n\n**Fall 2012 - Spring 2013**: Intern in San Francisco making $10\/hour with overtime and double time opportunities. Barely make it by, not paying any loans back currently. Rent is $750\/month and I\u2019m splitting a bedroom.\n\n**Spring 2013 - July2014**: Get a job in Chicago making $55K (no raise while there). Start paying minimum back in loans (around $300\/month I think). Rack up about $800 in CC debt buying furniture. Found a cheap studio ($615\/month). Expenses are going out, concerts, social, gym, occasional small trip travel. No car, health insurance through job. Contributing a small amount to 401K. Not saving much in cash.\n\n**July 2014 - September 2015**: Get a new job making $60K, slight title bump. No 401K option so I move my previous 401K to a Roth IRA, take a hit with not paying taxes until tax time but better in the long run. Move to another apartment at $750\/month. Occasionally pay more on loans, minimal savings. No car, expenses are traveling, social, etc.\n\n**September 2015 - March 2016**: Get a raise to $70K. Move to new studio at $1,050\/month. Similar financial situation, find out about r\/personalfinance.\n\n**March 2016 - June 2017**: Get a new job making $85K with a title bump. Move back to first building to a studio at $875\/month. Now able to pay more on loans occasionally ($1,000 here, $500 there). Around this time I\u2019m done paying parents loans. Contribute about 5% to 401K, save more in cash as I wanted a particular surgery (did not get it). Refinance with Sofi but it drops the APR down only 1% point.\n\n**June 2017 - August 2017**: Rent goes to $895\/month. I quit my job to freelance. Find a 2 month gig freelancing at $2,300\/week ($118K\/year roughly). I travel, have weddings so I hold a lot of cash. Stop contributing to my Roth and throw a lot of money at loans. \n\n**September 2017 - Today**: Got a new gig freelancing at another agency (6 month term) making $100\/hour ($150K roughly) with a title bump. Throw about $2K from savings and one week paycheck to pay the last loan off (~$,4000 total).\n\n**Things to note:**\n\n* I spend an average (over a year) of $450\/week on groceries\/travel\/clothes\/random things needed\/appointments\/wants.~$200\/week of this is on alcohol and eating out, critique if you\u2019d like but this is why I work so hard.\n\n* I pack my lunch nearly 4 days a week. Cook meals for the week on Sunday.\n\n* I work in the advertising industry, it can be volatile and I\u2019d say my path is a bit expedited but others have moved even faster. I worked my ass off at every agency and left each job on my own terms.\n\n* I got the freelance gigs through connections. I\u2019ve built my own network in Chicago, no relatives or friends. Slight help through portfolio school starting off.\n\n* When looking for jobs in Cleveland after undergrad and Chicago, I\u2019d make a list of places I\u2019d like to work. I\u2019d then find names on LinkedIn of recruiters, creative directors or anyone I could speak with. I\u2019d walk into the agency and ask to speak with said person or anyone in charge of hiring. Every place loved this and it\u2019s what got me my job in Cleveland and built my network in Chicago. I\u2019ve found jobs for about five friends through connections. I bring this up to not just emphasize my work ethic but to speak to all creatives who think there are no jobs out there. Emailing or just randomly connecting with people on LinkedIn will get you nowhere. There are a ton of jobs, not just in Chicago but in every market, the problem is they aren\u2019t always listed or they go to those with an immediate connection. Meet people, cold call, take a risk. You may not get a job today but you are now a real person who (if qualified) will be remembered when something does open up.\n\n\n**Ending Note**\nYou will get out of debt \u2014 this needs to be said more often. We think our current PF situation is forever, it\u2019s not. Jerry Seinfeld has a great quote (this isn\u2019t exact) \u201cNo payments until March. When people buy a car or couch, they think March will never come.\u201d The same is true for debt. We think it will never end but we need to live with the same mindset now that it IS gone. Having more money obviously makes you happy but a switch does not flip when you\u2019re debt free. You are still the same person with the same wants\/needs \u2014 it\u2019s up to you how you act on them.\n\n\n(Edit: Formatting, typos)\n","sentiment":"positive"}

{"selftext":"I originally majored in Electrical Engineering. I would have graduated with just $30,000 in student loans if I kept my scholarships. However, I didn\u2019t do very well in my engineering classes, so I lost my scholarships and switched to the pre-nursing track at the end of my junior year. I\u2019ll finish my prerequisite classes by the end of the spring semester and have two more years of school after that. If I stay in school, I\u2019ll graduate with $60-70,000 in loans with an 8.8% interest rate. That seems way too risky to me. I\u2019d be paying off my student loans well into my 30\u2019s if the economy is good, and for most of my life if there\u2019s another recession.

{"selftext":"I've been reading some of the other debt posts on here, but I think I need some tips on how to handle the overwhelming emotional feelings that come with debt as well as the actual debt itself - I'm having trouble keeping my head up in order to keep pushing through it.\n\nA bit of background, I'm a 24 year old recent-ish grad. I live in an expensive city because there are more job opportunities here than where I am from, and my entire network is here now. I am about $90,000 in debt from school. I chalk that up to being a dumb 18 year old and not having any foresight for the future and wanting to go to a good school and being willing to do whatever it took in order to do so, regardless of the impact that would have on my future finances. I didn't understand the true implications of being in debt at that point. I've got about $700 in credit card debt and another $1,000 personal loan, both from a brief unemployment period when I was struggling to pay rent.\n\nI'm currently making about $42,000 and I've gotten a lot better about budgeting. I'm currently working a job that I enjoy, but it is not in my field. I meal plan, I limit eating out to weekends (and even then, I try to eat at home when I can\/eat before going out so that I can order smaller meals). I still allow myself small indulgences so that I can have a social life\/enjoy the culture of the city. I'm trying to put about $100 into my savings a month. I'm proud of how much better I've gotten at budgeting, but it gets to the point where I feel guilty for any non-necessary expenses, even though I know realistically, buying a latte from Starbucks once a week or two isn't going to make or break my budget (and I know myself - if I don't treat myself once in a while, I'm going to to be tempted to stray further than my budget). I'm working on my most marketable skill (a knack for languages) through self-study and classes.\n\nMy loan payments are about $1,000 each month and combined with my other expenses\/bills\/money going towards savings, I'm pretty much going paycheck to paycheck and can't really afford to put extra money towards my loans unless it's a rare occasion like money I've received from my birthday or something like that. \n\nI know a lot of people are in the same boat, and I've been dutifully making my payments and being as financially responsible as I can, but I can't help but feel like I'm sinking. I know I'm getting ahead of myself, but I keep thinking about how I want to get married and start a family someday and I can't even fathom being able to afford having children (I am also \"on a timeline\" for that kind of thing, as I am a woman.) I will most likely need to go back to school at some point, which will most likely mean more loans. \n\nI've been considering applying for a Fulbright, which would be a dream of mine and which I honestly think if I really work hard at the application, I could have a small chance of getting. That's a literal dream of mine. But I'm afraid to even try and get my hopes up because I don't know how I would continue to pay my loans for a year along with the other expenses that inevitably come with traveling, even when some expenses are covered by grants or scholarships.\n\nI feel like 18 year old me closed all doors for 24 year old me when I signed my name to those loans. I know that's dramatic and if I keep working I can open those doors back up, but I don't know how to keep up the morale to do so. \n\ntl;dr Along with really buckling down and paying off your debt, how do you all keep up your morale and the \"I can handle this!\" attitude necessary to keep moving towards being debt-free?

We bought a house.  \n\nI make 75,000, he makes 125,000-160,000 (not sure exactly and it varies year to year.  We have a lot of student debt (100k?), and he messed up taxes in 2014 so we have 20,000 we owe there. I thought 2015 was good, apparently not. Now he's getting calls today from the accountant that 2016 is bad (owe roughly 36,000 more).  \n\nI've asked him forever to seek a financial advisor with how to operate his LLC.  He told me they just take your money and are out for themselves. He has a bunch of credit cards, how many? I don't know. He tells me it isn't my business. It's at least 5-6, he says the balances are low.  I found one he opened and the interest rate is 24%!  \n\nI'm livid.  It's an issue I've swept under the rug and I am so angry at myself. He says no matter how much he tries he can't get ahead. But I've said forever how he needed to put more aside and seek advice on how better to manage money. He has no retirement savings (he's 43).  He buys expensive groceries (organic everything, even mustard), records for himself and we both spend too much on booze. He also smokes. \n\nHe plans these great vacations and loves to hang out and have a good time but this is going on and things like breaks for the car and fixing his crown don't get done.

Using a throwaway as this post has too many personal details.\n\nBackground:\n\nMy wife &amp; I are in our early thirties.  We have three elementary-age children.  We made stupid decisions on low income in our teens and early twenties and just recently finished paying off over $100k in auto, CC, student loans &amp; other unsecured debt.  \n\nWe sold a house for which we overpaid.  I took a new job that paid more and was fortunate to receive several annual raises over 10%.  We made a budget and have stuck to it for the past six years.  We bought a new home with a 10-yr mortgage.  Things are looking better.\n\nCurrent situation:\n\nMonthly takehome pay is $6,500. Monthly mortgage + escrow is $1,600. Other monthly expenses total $1,525. Net cash at the end of each month = $3,375.  Mortgage balance is $130k.  We have 6 months of expenses in savings. Our neighborhood is rural and COL is extremely low.  No other debts; credit cards and other revolving debt have all been closed. Retirement savings is less than $100k in Roth at this point.  We intend to keep the current home for 15+ years\n\nMy employer offers no 401k, so I have been debating my best investment options at this point.  A few things that I have considered:\n\nA) Pour the net cash onto the mortgage and neglect retirement entirely.  If I pay an additional $3k per month, the mortgage is paid off in approximately 30 months.  Following payoff, monthly net cash increases by $1,600 which can then be applied to Roth &amp; brokerage account(s).\n\nB) Max out my Roth IRA then put the rest of net cash into brokerage account(s). Mortgage pays off in 115 months.\n\nC) Some varied combinations of paying different percentages toward the mortgage &amp; Roth.\n\nD) Whole life insurance.  Did much online research, found that this appears to be a borderline scam in many scenarios.  Would prefer to avoid.\n\nAny thoughts or suggestions?  Are there other tax-advantaged accounts besides my Roth that I should consider?  I've researched SEP IRA, 403b and 457 plans, none of which are an option for me.\n\nEDIT: formatting","sentiment":"positive"}

They are offering this only until tomorrow (got the letter earlier in the month).

I know this is the most serious, urgent, and dangerous of all the debts today.\n\nI also have a lot of medical debt ($20-$30k) which is owed to dozens of different places. Some is recent some is over 2 years old. Some is current, some is in collection, some is past due.\n\nStudent debt is $27k, no collection but in default. Probably going to collection soon. Any advice on contacting or changing student debt is welcome.\n\n\nMy other big question is should I consider chapter 7 bankruptcy?

I know I should not have waited so long, and it fills me with crippling anxiety daily.\n\nMy situation: I went to college on a series of scholarships and federal loans.  I could not get a job in my field until several months after graduation, and having an on-campus job I had to give up after graduation, being rurally isolated, and being plain ragged stupid meant I was making no money for six months.\n\nObviously, student loans came calling for repayment immediately. I was very stupid and scared, and didn't pay them -- not that I had anything to pay them with.  Even when I started working in a low-pay entry level position, I could barely pay rent.\n\nWage garnishment followed for several years, of course.  I went through a lot of phone calls that terrified me, a few settlements, etc.  \n\nIn all this, I have never had a credit card. My last loan was an auto loan in 2008, from my local-yokel bank that I've had accounts with since I was a kid (meaning they probably didn't even check my credit). I discharged the loan years ago.\n\nBut still the specter of student loans was there. It's been 13 years since graduation, and I realize how utterly dumb I've been. First step was admitting it. The next step was facing up to the credit score, which I was sure would be abysmal. But it's like that nagging pain in your chest -- just because you don't go to the doctor to get it checked, it doesn't mean there isn't a problem. \n\nSo I checked it...and it doesn't exist. I have no credit score.  \n\nAll the bills I pay (on time, always) are in my husband's name.

{"selftext":"Like most British students, student finance does not cover your rent, so you have to either rely on your parents, get a part time job or get a student overdraft.\n\nI got a part time job through uni and as a backup I got a \u00a3200 overdraft just in case. It\u2019s worth mentioning that student overdrafts are interest free and there is no fee for going into your overdraft. It can be increased up to \u00a31,000 (sometimes more). \n\nThis July I graduated from University with a fairly healthy looking bank account and the world at my feet. My parents, who have always either worked part time or self employed, have never supported me and maintain the outlook of \u201cOnce uni is over, you\u2019re on your own financially.\u201d \n\nThey wanted me to own a car, insurance and to have moved out by this Christmas. I do not know where they have gained this mentality from as both of their parents supported them both until they were well into their 20s. \n\nIn August, they guilt tripped me into leaving my perfectly fine part time retail job as they thought it was \u2018ridiculous\u2019 and \u2018pathetic\u2019 that I was 21 with a degree and still working in retail (keep in mind I graduated in July). I was uncomfortable being unemployed, so whilst I was applying for jobs in my field of study, I applied for a few more part time jobs and just told myself I\u2019d somehow keep it a secret from them (naive). \n\nThey began mounting serious pressure on me to buy a car, despite me not having any real need for one. I explained that now I was unemployed, I could not afford one. They then asked me how I expected to get a car without a job and a job without a car...\n\nThe week that was discussed I went to stay elsewhere for a bit out of utter confusion.\n\nWhen I returned, they told me that my only option was to extend my student overdraft to \u00a31,000 and buy a car with that money so that I could drive to jobs. I got a job interview I was incredibly excited about but parents said I needed a car before I went to the interview as \u201cI cannot rely on trains forever\u201d. I joked that they should buy me a car if they wanted me to have one so much...it did not go down well. \n\nAfter being unemployed for about a month and a half, I started to get depressed and my parents started to become angry with me. I told them I had been applying for the secret part time jobs just for a bit of income whilst searching for something bigger and they said that they were disappointed in me for that and that instead they had discussed what was best and they still want me to extend the overdraft and buy a car. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that most of the part time job people had gotten back to me politely explaining that they don\u2019t hire graduates. \n\nAfter sticking to my guns for few weeks I finally landed a job only to be told by my mother I couldn\u2019t take it because she read on the news someone was murdered about a mile away back in 07 and they never caught who did it. My bank balance was now at \u00a30 and feeling like I was at my wits end, I begged my parents to tell me what to do. \n\nThey told me I couldn\u2019t expect to get anywhere in life without a car...At this point I\u2019d given up...I made them promise me that if I wasn\u2019t in full time employment within a month of owning the car...I could sell it. \n\nSo you can guess where I am right now. A bizarre silver lining to this Story is that my parents paid for my insurance which was about \u00a3800!!! That\u2019s the most they\u2019ve ever spent on me and it felt good...but I am now -\u00a31,000 in debt with \u00a3150 for road tax coming out of my bank account on the 19th October...It will obviously decline the payment.\n\nMy parents have told me selling the car is no longer an option. Their attention has now moved to getting me out by Christmas, I\u2019ve been told that a distant Aunt is giving me \u00a3300 in November to use as a deposit on a flat...\n\nToday I found out that I got a full time job and I am so happy but I will not get paid in time to pay for my road tax. I told my parents this today and they said that this kind of thing builds character and that I\u2019ll find a way to get the money in time because I\u2019ll have to... \n\nPlease help me, what do I do?\nMy mind is currently telling me to sell the car and deal with the repercussions...but I\u2019m honestly afraid they\u2019ll kick me out to \u2018build my character\u2019 \n\nShall I sell every thing I own?

{"selftext":"So I'm looking to see what, if any, options my wife and I may have regarding our very high debt situation.\n\nTwo kids, late teens. We've had a large number of issues over the years (medical, major house repair issues, major vehicle repair issues, out of work for an extended period of time) and decisions for years for her to focus on the kids and not work. She started working part-time a few years ago and for financial purposes moved to a full-time position earlier this year. We're still not able to stay on top of things though. Those issues combined with living above our means (it's not like we're taking vacations, have boats or anything like that though) and putting the kids  ahead of our fiscal stability got us into this position. What I mean by that is things like our daughter continuing dance classes she's taken for 13 years now, son continuing soccer, playing golf for his high school, etc. Right or wrong, I'm not looking for anyone to judge. It is what it is. \n\nCombined incomes are around $120k per year, but we're struggling with a large amount of CC debt, which is shown below. Typical family of four expenses with a house. Gas, food, electric, phone, internet, car insurance (with two teenagers, neither of them has a car though), medical insurance, homeowners, etc. We limit eating out to once a week, but just feeding a family of four alone is expensive. \n\nItem | Balance | Rate | Payment | Notes\n---------|----------|----------|----------|----------\nMortgage | $112k | 4.75% | $884 | 30 year fixed beginning 9\/1\/14\nCar 1 | $13k | 2.24% | $282 | Pay off date 5\/14\/21\nCar 2 | $25k | 2.5% | $388 | Pay off date 1\/29\/23\nVisa 1 | $24k | 10.74% | $450 | Limit $24k\nVisa 2 | $25.6k | 7.9 % &amp; 8.9% | $550 | Limit 26k. \n\n$199.6k Debt total. $2,554 total per month.\n\nWe've got essentially nothing in savings and are living paycheck to paycheck. I have one IRA that is worth $19k and neither of us is currently contributing towards any type of retirement savings. We have a few thousand dollars in upcoming expenses as well. $2k in car repairs that we're trying to push off. $2k in home repairs after the hurricane here that we're having to do. \n\nWe also are heading into our oldest going to college next year. So that upcoming expense is coming as well. However, years ago when the kids were both born my parents gifted them both stock that is currently still invested. Current stock valuations are $25k for the oldest (starts college next year, so would be liquidated soon to help towards school) and 20k for the youngest. Stock is in both our names and their names as well.\n\nI know that the debt consolidation stuff isn't really a solution from reading here.\n\nOptions that we're seeing currently.\n\n- Option One: Continue cutting more and more, but we've been doing this for several years now. \n\n- Option Two: Liquidate the $19k IRA and pay it towards the two CC's. All to one, split up, etc.\n\n- Option Three: Speak with a bankruptcy attorney and possibly head down that path. Obvious concerns here include the impact on everything, the IRA, stock for the kids college, etc.\n\nAny advise would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks","sentiment":"negative"}

{"selftext":"I'm working on paying off my final student loan ($37k @ 4.31% variable), and since it will take about a year to pay off in full I want to make sure I do it intelligently. I have narrowed down my options to the following three general strategies, and I would love to hear any personal stories or advice you may have regarding any of these 3 options depending on your own experiences with debt pay down:\n\n1) Do a \"Gazelle Intense\" payoff a la Dave Ramsey. I'd have ~$4,500 in savings (3 months of expenses) and would pay $2,000 to $2,500 each month extra towards my loan.\n\n2) Save half of my discretionary income each month and put the other half ($1000 to $1250 per month) towards my loan. When my savings is high enough I would do a lump sum payoff.\n\n3) Pay the current minimum ($316 per month) and save $2,000 to $2,500 each month until I have enough saved up to do a lump sum payoff.\n\nThe decision I have to make is weighing the benefit of saving on interest payment vs having the security of building a strong savings. Option 1 would save about $1,100 in interest compared to Option 3. Option 2 saves quite a bit on interest as well since the extra payments dig into the principle balance early on.\n\nAll options would have me paying off the loan in 13 to 15 months. My employment situation is stable, but a big part of me would feel most secure if I save up a lot of money via Option 3 and then completely end the monthly payment obligation. Realistically, however, Option 2 would also give me plenty of saving to fall back on in case I get laid off.  \n\nI understand that this is ultimately my decision, but I have always enjoyed the feedback that this sub offers and would like to hear how you approached your debt and why.

Throw in 2 kids, gall bladder surgery for both of us, credit card debt out the yang, (which found out in February I have Bipolar II disorder, which makes sense now of why I always ran up the credit cards when I shouldn't have), and multiple heart attacks\/heart caths, and a job lost because of husbands health issues that we had to file bankruptcy in 2010.  \n\n\nSince then, it's been a total thyroidectomy, multiple heart attacks\/heart caths, and another lost job because of health issues.  Then I had to stop working in 2013 due to my health issues.  I am currently in the process of getting disability, with a hearing coming up in a week.  \n\n\nIn that time, we have tried stay afloat.  My parents, sister, and in laws have all helped us to make sure we didn't lose our house, or anything.  My inlaws currently still help us, by giving us a certain amount every 2 weeks, which pays our mortgage.  The rest is from my husbands job that he currently is in.  Which, honestly, I get worried about him losing if he has any more health issues.  My husband makes around $46k a year.\n\n\nWe have been extremely lucky to have the help we have had.  We do not want to give up our house, if we don't have to.  It would mean living with my parents, and yeah....don't want to do that unless it's a final thing we have to do.\n\n\nBreakdown of what we owe a month:\n\nMortgage: $780 - went through a loan modification earlier this year, so it's $200 less than it was.  Still owe about $89,000.\n\nElectric: $160 - varies\/on an AMP\n\nGas: $50-$60 - varies to time of year\n\nWater\/Trash\/Ambulance: $110\n\nCable\/Internet\/Home Phone: $160\n\nCell phones:$225 - 3 people, yes smart phones, and we do payment plans if our phone breaks and tack it onto the phone plan.\n\nCar insurance: $120\n\nCopays for doctors: $25 or $40, depending on which doctor, and usually it's at least once a month, if not multiple times a month.\n\nMedications: $125 \n\nTuition for son's school: $165 - This is a new addition.  My son has Autism, ADHD, and learning disabilities.  He started at a private school for kids that have those exact issues.  He got a fairly substantial scholarship to the school, but it doesn't cover everything.  That's what we have to pay a month until the school year is over in May.\n\nYMCA- $77\n\nMedical Bills:\n$50.00 with $272 left to pay \n\n$25.00 with $300 left to pay\n\n$63.00 with $630 left to pay\n\n$25.00 with $4029 left to pay - This is from Feb 2015, last heart attack\/heart cath\n\n$25.00 with $940 left to pay - this is from November 2015 from an MRI I had to have\nThere are probably a few miscellaneous bills we get from appts.  I just had one go to collections and get added to one of the $25 accounts.  I know you should pay more to the higher accounts, but the smaller ones were done first, so once those are paid, I will pay the higher ones a bit more.\n\nGroceries: $400 to $500 a month.  I try to look for the best deals that I can during the week, and I buy every 2 weeks.  We may have to buy things like bread or milk if we run out, but we try to plan out meals. Plus both kids take their lunch to school, so that saves on school meals.\n\nGasoline: $150 a month.\n\nLego Club for my son for socialization at school: $60 every 9 weeks.\n\nAfter School care for my son: $60 a month, but will go up to $80 when his therapy is finished soon.\n\nVolleyball for my daugher: $65 every season\n\nI think that's pretty much everything.  When paying bills and doing banking, I try to leave as much as I can in the account, so that if anything pops up, we can take care of it.  The kicker is that we always have things that come up, and make it really hard to pay for things.\n\nPlus making sure my kids have clothes, and shoes, and making sure my husband has work clothes and shoes.  I kind of go to the sidelines when it comes to that stuff, unless I absolutely have to have something.  And I really need a lot of stuff, but the kids and hubby are more important.  We eat out maybe 4 times a month, and it's always super super cheap.  Unless it's for birthday, then we go a little more expensive.  \n\nThe lego club and volleyball are both something my kids want to do. I'm not going to deny them the chance to do it either.  It's small in change compared to them getting to do what they would love to do and the social interaction it gives them.\n\nThe big kicker: $35k in student loans that I got a collections letter for.  And it's been turned over to several collection agencies through the years apparently. I am following the protocol for asking to verify the debt etc.  It's 2 loans, both from Nelnet, but belonged to another company before that.  It's been knocked around for a long time.  And if they were mine, they couldn't be dissolved from bankruptcy in our state, and they are private loans.\n\nAny advice, thoughts, suggestions would be awesome.  I know that I am probably not the worst case ever, and writing it all out doesn't sound so bad.  But it's the getting down to $20 for a week because we had to pay out for stuff that wasn't planned.  \n\nI appreciate your time and help.\n","sentiment":"negative"}

So, if I understand it correctly, I teach for 5 years at a Title I school and get the $17,500 off of my loans, then I have to start the payments for 10 years to qualify for loan forgiveness. \n\nIf I understand this correctly, to get the most out of the programs, it seems that common advice is to get on an income-driven repayment plan while i am qualifying for these programs. The total time I will spend in these programs is 15 years, which means my loans will be paid off sometime around when I am 37.\n\nDo I have this figured out right? The resources at my college are not very helpful. I know common sense says to take the money I have and just start repaying loans, but I was thinking maybe it would be better if I held onto the money and perhaps invested it somewhere until I needed to start paying (after graduation) and start making the minimum monthly payment for those loans then. If that is the case, should I just invest most of my money in the meantime and let it grow to help pay with loans instead of letting it sit in a savings account? If you got this far, I appreciate you taking the time to read this. It is also just overwhelming to me. \n\nTL;DR: Should I start paying off my loans right now, or invest the money and let it grow? I will qualify for loan forgiveness programs, but only after I have taught for 5 years will $17500 come off, and after 15 will the remaining balance come off. Would it make more sense to wait until I have to start paying and pay the monthly minimums or should I start paying off now?","sentiment":"negative"}

I also have accidental insurance with Aflac and an additional insurance policy through my players' association.

He looked at my x-rays, did a few simple mobility tests and was certain I was sentenced to surgery to repair my knee cap.

{"selftext":"Continuing off the title, I\u2019m a sophomore in college coming from a middle class background and my family has been consistently terrible at managing money. This is amplified by the fact that my dad has suffered pay cuts and has struggled to find another job. Over summer, it got so bad that he started driving for Uber and had to borrow money that I made from my summer internship to pay bills. Also, my parents are in the process of divorcing (mainly driven by financial reasons) but are still living together because they can't afford two separate places and they\u2019re on good terms. Naturally, their lifestyle has been pretty modest.\n\nAs for me, I'm currently a student living in the dorms of an in-state public university. Last year, after scholarship and need-based aid, my family took out about $10,000 in student loans which left around $8,000 on the table and we made it through the year. Altogether, my parents put forward under $2,000 of their own money toward my education last year. Coming into this year, I let my parents handle financial aid then went on to check a couple weeks ago and saw that my mom had taken out an abnormally high amount. After running some calculations, I saw that the total loan amount was $20,000, nearly double what we needed. I approached her about it and broke down the math then she said that it was what we had done last year. I'm not sure if she actually believed that or if she was just getting defensive or whatever, but she said that the interest on the loans didn't start accruing until later so I figured that there wouldn't be much harm in having the money out right now.\n\nSo I left back for college a bit over a month ago and just kinda put that behind me. I know that despite my parents' best intentions, their promises to pay back my student loans are empty and I'll be paying them back myself. I'm confident in my job prospects out of graduation so I\u2019m not too worried. They're going through a lot, I got this.\n\nAnyway, scene cuts to a couple days ago and I have lunch with my mom for the first time since I moved in. She suggests a rather upscale place and says not to worry about it because she's paying. She also dropped $400 for her and my sister to go see a show then realized that they missed the date so she dropped another $400 for the right tickets. Then she was talking about going out with her friends for drinks and such like she was doing it multiple times a week. I thought it was abnormal but didn't think too much into it.\n\nIt kinda dawned on me the next day that the lifestyle change almost perfectly coincided with the deposit of my student loans. I\u2019m not exactly sure how each loan works but I know that at least around half of the $20,000 is in my parents\u2019 name. I don\u2019t know for sure if she is using my student loans for these purposes and she has been working full time, but I can\u2019t imagine where else the money would be coming from because I know she hasn\u2019t gotten a raise in at least the past year. Is this something that can happen with student loans? Should I approach her about this (and how)? Any advice would be appreciated.\n\nEdit: Just to clarify, there's absolutely no animosity between my parents and I. We're still a family.\n\nEdit 2: It sounds like my mom is drawing from the Parent Plus loan pool which isn't in my name. Still not a good situation but at least it's not affecting my credit I don't think?\n\nEdit 3: Appreciate all the responses, it's good to hear that this won't fall too heavily on me no matter what happens.","sentiment":"negative"}

{"selftext":"I recently graduated from a Big Ten school in May with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. I am very fortunate that I do not have any student debt, and a relatively sizable savings for a 23 y\/o. My parents worked hard, were very frugal, and made a very healthy living, and didn't require me to pay for college. I basically paid for my \"wants\" and they paid for my \"needs\" until I graduated and got my post grad job.\n\nCurrently, I make a gross income of 60k a year working for a defense contracting company.\nRight now I have:\nSavings: $21,000\nChecking: $1,800\nBrokerage Account: ~$3,200 with Wealthfront\nCredit Card Debt: $0. I seldom use my credit card in favor of using my debit card. \n401k: $1,200\nMy company matches 50% on contributions up to 10%. I am contributing 10.5% (10% to pretax 401k and 0.5% to Roth 401k). I also put $100 per month into my Wealthfront account. When determining how to allocate my money for 401k and Wealthfront portfolios, I did their surveys to help determine where to put my money. I let both accounts manage for me.\n\nExpenses:\nRent + Parking: $1,040 a month. Rent includes utilities, cable, internet, etc.\nSpotify: $10 per month\nGym membership: ~$400 per year\nGas: I don't have a good number for this. I just pay as I need.\nSupplements: I don't have a concrete number for this, I pay as I run out. Probably around $110 per month\nGroceries: ~$80 per week. I also have a rewards plan set up with my grocery store such that I get a certain $ per gallon savings on gas depending on the amount of money I spend and the things I buy. I end up saving about $1.10 per gallon on one tank of gas a month.\nLeisure: I don't track these expenses very closely.\nHaircut: ~$30 every 5 weeks\nAmazon Prime: $100 per year\n\nI don't really have any concrete savings plans and goals. I have a loose goal of saving around $200 per week. I get paid weekly, with my whole paycheck (after tax and 401k deductions) going to my personal checking account. At the end of the week, I add up all of my expenses from the week, taking into account a weekly equivalent of the expenses above, and move the remaining money to my personal savings account. I do my best to be frugal and mindful of the fact I want to save, and end up saving anywhere from $150 to $330 per week. This varies so much due to the fact that it depends on whether or not I got gas, groceries, and\/or supplements in the same week.\n\nSince I have no debt and I have no plans of purchasing a car or taking out any loans in the near future, I believe I am in a good position to establish myself fairly young. I feel like I am ahead of the game, despite my loose savings plan, but would like some help determining where I can help take myself to the next level. I have read a decent amount of threads but would like a more personalized recommendation. More specifically, how can I improve my investments to maximize gains, can I better allocate money to my investments, any other accounts I can open, is there an effective, yet easy way to save, etc.\n\nThanks in advance!","sentiment":"positive"}

I asked to have them send a bill, which they did.  Reading it over, I called back asking why I didn't recieve any bill prior to it being sent to a collector.

{"selftext":"Hi!\n\nWas hoping somebody here might be able to guide me in what I should do next regarding my debt. \n\nI was terrible with money from a young age, racking up credit card debt early in my adulthood... Basically, it got to a point where I was pretty deep in the water in debt. While I was making my monthly payments as promised (awesome credit score, high 750's), I never really planned on a fallback if anything ever happened to my income. I was slapped hard with reality after being laid off, and out of work for 7 months. All my credit cards and personal loans fell behind, as I prioritized rent, food, and living expenses. It was a mess.\n\nFast forward to present day. I'm now 38,000 in debt (Two personal loans, and the rest credit.) Most of these accounts are severely past due, and have closed, causing my credit score to shatter into pieces. I'm back to work now, took a little paycut compared to my last job, but overall a much more stable job. \n\nI've budgeted everything out, and am able to spend upto $585 a month on these debts. Not really sure how practical that is, either. I'm weighing out the following options... and was hoping people could share some insight in pros\/cons to each of them... and\/or if there are other options on the table that I'm not aware of.\n\n1. I initially started looking into debt consolidation. The few places I looked into were saying the monthly payments were going to be around $700 monthly, and the debts wouldn't be paid off for 6-7 years. This is already above my budget, and the 7 year payoff really turned me off.\n2. I've spoken with two debt settlement companies. While settling these debts doesn't look great on my credit, it's still better than filing bankruptcy or simply defaulting on them entirely. The monthly payments ranged from $500-600 (which is closer to what I have available in my budget). The settlements typically are done within 4 years. This seemed very reasonable. My only worry is the legal action that my debtors might take on me during the negotiation... any thoughts on this?\n3. I could personally reach out to each of my creditors to try and negotiate reasonable payment plans (The few I've spoken with don't seem to be very flexible on the amount I pay). I just don't see how I could honestly pay all of them every month separately, and it be within my budget.\n4. Really want to avoid filing bankruptcy if I can. I'm not entirely closed to the idea... I just worry that it'll prevent me from buying a house within the next few years (the whole 'your credit will be doomed for 7 years' thing.)\n\nThoughts\/Ideas\/Hope?\n","sentiment":"negative"}

Because I'm careful with finances, I don't anticipate actually using that credit unless it's an emergency; the existence of more credit doesn't represent a temptation to reckless spending for me.\n\nAm I missing something here, though?

I've worked out all the finances and grants I'd be eligible for, and how much I'd have to take out in loans if I work part time and keep living costs as low as possible... it puts me right at $20k.

{"selftext":"My wife and I just closed on a debt consolidation in the form of a home equity line of credit.  \n\nWe set it up so our monthly payments are very near what we were paying in minimum payments.

Unfortunately we lost our cat over the weekend and she's extremely heartbroken, and no where near the mental state to seek financial advice on Reddit or elsewhere.  \n\nOur cat's condition required emergency surgery at a NY vet hospital ($$$), numerous tests and diagnostics, plus an extended and unforeseen ICU stay.  We put her to sleep yesterday as it was clear the remaining options were only getting more and more drastic and even in the best case, she wouldn't be coming home anytime soon.  In addition to regretting the decision to pursue surgery because it didn't help our cat, my GF is very embarrassed about the financial situation she's now in.  \n\nBottom line, the bill from the vet hospital is approx. $20,000.  I've provided about $3,500 to date and had to tell her that was my limit.  The remaining balance is about $10,000 on Care Credit and the rest on her existing credit cards (I believe split over two cards).  \n\nShe doesn't have any free savings and only a small amount in a 401k.  And short of a rich family member stepping in, there's no way she's going to pay off the credit cards and Care Credit any time soon as she doesn't have a full time job.  She has a few freelance gigs and a food service job a couple nights - but she's making just few hundred dollars a week.  I think she's going to have to really hustle and find a full time job that provides a much better income, but that's not a sure thing and gong to take time.  \n\nIn the meantime, what can she do to limit damage to her credit and the outrageous interest her credit cards and Care Credit are bound to slap her with?

{"selftext":"TL;DR: Sprint in-store sales associate tricked me into replacing a contract I had already signed (that was supposed to cover my buyout from my previous Verizon contract) with a much more expensive bundle plan. My auto-pay kept failing to work, and soon, my phone service got disabled. I tried to sign into my online account to investigate, and found out that my Sprint account simply didn't exist anymore. Now I'm in debt collection for BOTH Sprint and Verizon, and I can't access my account to resolve the case with Sprint. \n\n\n-------------\n\nOn March 4th, I ordered an iPhone 7 on Sprint's online store with a new plan. I was formerly a Verizon customer, and Sprint made a contract buyout offer along with trade-in for my old phone as part of their promotion. I was happy with the deal I got, and scheduled to pick up my phone at the Palo Alto store the next day. \n\nThe next day, I went to the store at the scheduled time. The store rep, Kevin, had trouble finding my order, even though I had the order confirmation e-mail detailing my new plan, device I was supposed to pick up, the trade-in and buyout detail, all of it. \n\nHe then went into the back and brought out my new phone, and proceeded to make me sign a whole bunch of things. He also told me I would be getting a new tablet, to which I responded, \u201cBut I don't need a tablet\". He assured that I won't be paying a penny for it, that it was part of the promotion. I confirmed, at least three times, that I won't be paying anything for this. He smiled nicely and said \"Yes, take it, it's completely free. In fact, I'll also add in a free screen protector and a phone case for you, go pick out the one you like!\" You can imagine how excited and lucky I felt to score a whole bunch of free stuff. He then made me sign the contract\u2014and I said \"Wait, but I already signed everything online, why am I going through this again?\" He said it was a pick-up procedure.Then I noticed that the amount on the receipt for the monthly plan for was WAY higher than the plan I had selected. He said \"Oh it's just the initial payment; you'll go back to paying for the original plan from the next month. You'll also be getting your trade-in credit starting with the next billing cycle.\" Then he asked me to swipe a credit card. But I had already paid for the whole thing online! Why am I paying for this again? I even had the receipt with me in my inbox. He said something I didn't fully understand, but basically assured me that I had nothing to worry about. I left the store with a new phone decked with gears and a new tablet, all happy. \n\nLater that night, I received an e-mail from Sprint saying that my pickup order had been cancelled since 24 hours has passed and the product hadn\u2019t been picked up. I was confused but thought it was a glitch on their system. That was a mistake. In the mean time, that e-mail reminded me that I should setup my online account on Sprint's website and see what\u2019s going on with the whole Verizon contract buyback thing. But their website was down for renovation! It went on for the next 4 days or so. I was slightly worried about the buyout but at least I had the auto-pay going on, so I decided not to get frustrated and forget about it for the time being. \n\nA week or so later, my account still not setup, I resorted to their Live Chat to ask about the buyout deal. I gave them my order number, they had trouble locating the device I turned in that\u2019s associated with my account, and the rep told me \u201cI\u2019m going to reach out to my superior and have her contact you as soon as possible!\u201d No one reached out to me, via phone or e-mail, ever. It\u2019s still unsolved.\n\nThen a month later, I was charged for a late fee because turns out, my auto-pay had... disappeared. Weird, but I paid for the fee and setup auto-pay again. The month after that, the auto-pay had disappeared again, and I paid for a higher amount again. The next month, it happened again. I realized something was wrong. The amount I was paying for, even with the penalty fee, was absurdly high for what I thought I should've been paying. I should've acted on it right away, but caught up with life, I let a month or two pass, before finally visiting a store in Mountain View. \n\nWhen I sat down with the store rep in the MV location and started going through my account information with him, he told me that the initial order I made online had been cancelled because I didn\u2019t pick it up. Wait, what? What\u2019s this phone I have now then? He told me \u201cWell it looks like the person at the Palo Alto store set you up with a new device and a plan\u2026\u201d And I wasn\u2019t aware that I was signing a whole new contract? With a bundle pricing that I wasn\u2019t told about? And my contract buyout detail disappeared with it? The person told me \u201cYea, you should probably go back to the Palo Alto location and either talk to the guy that did this to you or their manager.\u201d \n\nThen guess what happens. As I was about to agree and get up from my seat, I spot Kevin\u2014yes, the same Kevin from the Palo Alto location! I called him over, he sat down with me, went through my account, and realized what was going on. He told me \u201cYea you\u2019ll have to go back to the Palo Alto location and talk to the manager there.\u201d And I was like, \u201cYou\u2019re the one that did this!\u201d That same convo repeated for the next 15 minutes. Beyond exhausted from frustration, I caved in. I asked him to give me a written note of this situation so I don\u2019t have to spend another 30 minutes back at the PA location trying to explain what happened all over again. \nHe goes \u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d \nI asked why he couldn\u2019t, and he said \u201cI\u2019m not allowed to do that.\u201d \nThat conversation went on for another 15 minutes. He finally said, \u201cI\u2019ll make a note of this on the system, so whoever looks at your account from any other branch will be able to see it.\u201d Suspicious, I asked to glance at this \u201cnote\u201d he was making to make sure he was writing down the right stuff. Or anything at all. \nHe goes, \u201cI can\u2019t allow you to do that.\u201d \nLet me point out that, meanwhile, the first rep I was talking to, a big muscle guy with a thick accent, has been standing behind Kevin this whole time, with his arms crossed, giving me what felt like a death glare, legitimately scaring me. Since I was convinced that there wasn\u2019t going to be any \u201cnote\u201d and I worried that they were going to deny that this whole conversation ever took place, I turned to him and asked for his name. He goes, \u201cYou don\u2019t need my name.\u201d I told him I just wanted to be able to explain what happened in this store at the other branch. He\u2019s silent. I turned to Kevin, and asked for his name. He refuses to give me his last name. When I asked again, he mumbles something I cannot understand. I asked for his business card, he reluctantly hands me one, and I leave the store, still in shock by what just happened. \n\nI went on a trip abroad the following month, and came back and went online to deal with this again. Then I realized that my account was now completely disappeared. They don\u2019t have my e-mail on their system. They don\u2019t have any account associated with my phone number. I tried talking to someone on Live Chat, and they asked me for my PIN and the answer to the security question, which, I actually don\u2019t remember setting, and none of the combinations that I could ever think of (like any average person, I only use 1 PIN combination\u2026) worked. They told me to go into the store. \n\nSo I went into another store this time, in San Jose, with my original receipt, the cancellation e-mail, the contract I ended up signing at the store, and the receipt for it. The rep that was helping me, Stephen, was the nicest guy ever. Having lost all faith in Sprint\u2019s customer service, talking to Stephen was like a gift from God. He was able to verify that, based on all the documents I brought in, my account did match my phone number and that my device had been switched from the one I originally ordered, with a bundle contract. He also told me that there wasn't any \"note\" made on my account by Kevin. Go figure. And what's more, if I decided to pay for the device, contract, the penalties and be done with it, I'd have to pay over $11,000. $11,000!!!!!! Let me remind you that this doesn't count the amount that went into debt collection from the Verizon contract that never got paid for. \n\nStephen tried to help, but with the account gone, there wasn\u2019t anything he can do. So he told me to call customer service with the store phone. I talked to someone on the phone, she told me there wasn't anything she could do with the account gone, Stephen hopped in and verified my information, and she said she could send me the PIN and security question detail to the e-mail associated with my account. Hooray! \nExcept, the e-mail never came. \nIt was closing hour for the store so I come home, and the e-mail still didn\u2019t come. The next day, I went back to the live chat and explained this whole situation AGAIN, and asked to send another e-mail. That e-mail never came either. I called customer service, went through it all again, that e-mail never came. I go back to the live chat, and this time got connected to a senior customer service representative. I explained everything again, he couldn't figure out why I\u2019m not receiving the e-mail. He went away to do some digging and came back to tell me that my account was now being handled by a debt collection and all account detail removed, without me ever getting notified of this. He told me that his hands were tied and in order to access my account, I should go to a store branch with my ID.\u2026.. Yea that worked before.\n\nSo, here I am. Duped into a bundle plan I never knew I was signing up for, with one tablet I never needed (which, by the way, I gave to my mom, who gave it to her friend), one phone that hasn\u2019t worked in the past 4-5 months, my Sprint account in debt collection, my Verizon contract in debt collection. \n\nWhat now? \n","sentiment":"negative"}

{"selftext":"Best way to pay for repair our broken well water system? We've only been in the house 3 weeks.\n\nSo let me get this out of the way before the chewing begins: we knowingly and voluntarily elected to not get the well inspected before closing on the home. We are in a super high-demand market and the amount of time it would take to get the inspection completed would have meant losing out on the home (it was the 6th we offered on, for the record). Not that it's relevant but we did manage to squeeze in a standard home inspection. Even knowing what I know now, and living in a house that currently has no running water, **I still wouldn't go back in time to tell myself to do a well inspection** we would've lost out on the house because we took too long and others would've offered to close more quickly. And to be frank, I love this house.\n\nAnyways, we only moved in three weeks ago, and when I came home Thursday my partner announced we have no running water. Yay. Got a company that specializes in wells and pumps to come out mid-day Friday. They spent a few hours being nice, but also quite useless. They HIGHLY suspect there's a break in the main line from the well to the house. Extra yay.\n\nSo, currently, we're already on the hook for a $2,750 bill for the replacement of the pump and other ultimately unhelpful things they poked and prodded at. That was just for yesterday. We still don't have running water. \n\n* JUST to get water running we're looking at having to hire an electrician to fix the wiring problem, and to dig up some of our yard to find the break in the line and fix or replace it.\n* ON TOP of that, there's the cost of replacing the pressure tank. - At this point we'd have running water, but not safe water.\n* So, ON TOP of that, there's the cost of fixing the water radon system which they called a \"dinosaur\" and didn't have a clue how to deal with.\n\nI don't know the total cost of fixing everything. They told us we could potentially save some money by doing the digging ourselves - which we've already done. Silver lining being that they were pretty sure the break isn't that far down because there's a ton of moss around the well cap, and sure enough we dug not that far down and hit a fair amount of water, so that does seem to be confirmed.\n****\nBut what's the best way to pay for this? We only moved in three weeks ago and are more cash strapped than we planned to be (we wanted to offer 3% down on the house, sellers weren't comfortable with that down payment, so we had to up it to 5% which ate up a lot of the cash we were planning on having for, well, things like this.)\n\n**Current options:**\n\n* **Credit Cards:** Obviously I don't *want* to do this. Neither my partner nor myself has any credit card debt, thankfully, and my own credit card has a $8,900 limit with a 22% APR. His is almost maxed out from the first plumber bill and a couple of other payments this month, and his limit is only around the $4,000 mark. - We could also potentially look at opening a new card that has a 0% APR introductory promo offer? We currently only have 1 credit card each, so I'm not sure this is so bad?\n\n* Take out a **personal loan:** The credit union affiliated with my employer has personal loans with 6.24% APR, so, better than an average credit card. But I'm worried about getting approval for this - we just bought a house, we have no cash, we also decided to finance some furniture purchases (which we can comfortably afford the monthly payment for - it just won't look like that to a bank) that we can't return. So for the sake of advice-giving, assume they might reject us.\n\n* Someone mentioned this to me once but I don't know what it's called or if it's a thing - but they said you could borrow against your car value? I have an '08 honda that's completely paid off - wouldn't know where to begin with this or if it's actually a smart option.\n\nShould probably clarify that I think we can manage a reasonable monthly payment for this - I just don't know what's the best method to avoid paying it all upfront (which we can't do).\n\n**Not options:**\n\n* Asking for money from family is not an option\n\n* HELOC (from what I understand of them) is not an option? We just bought the house with a 5% down payment, so there isn't any equity in the place yet.\n\n* Selling organs, etc.\n\nI'm open to ideas and advice. You can keep your pitchforks down about not getting the inspection done - I absolutely agree they're EXTREMELY important to do. We took the risk anyways because the risk of things like what's happening now wasn't worth the risk of losing the house. In the grand scheme of things, this isn't that bad, I'm just trying to handle it wisely as we're short on cash.","sentiment":"negative"}

At first I justified charging everything because I had a job with a lot of growth\/ income opportunity. Yet I wasn't able to make it to the point where I became  a top earner and during the process was barely making any money. On top of that I was unemployed for a few months and had to charge my card just to eat.

{"selftext":"Hello all. I have been trying to fix my credit for the last couple of years and have actually been doing very well using the advice I have read on this subreddit. I somehow misread an invoice from a doctor and paid them $19 dollars less than what I should have. Thinking I had paid it off I didn't give it any more thought until a $19 collection account showed up on my report. I tried to send them a certified letter asking for them to remove the debt from my report in exchange for payment while not acknowledging the debt. They must not have even read the letter and just sent me over the bill. What should I do? It's such small debt but I have worked so hard to get everything removed from my report I am at a loss of what to do here. I want to buy a house in the next year or two and I don't want to worry about this. Should I just pay it or should I try to send another certified letter? Thank you all for your advice.

{"selftext":"Hello personal finance,\n\nI have been increasing my financial awareness and responsibility over the past few months for the first time in my life. I have paid off several small debts I had been ignoring and completely changed my spending\/budgeting habits. My question is, I have only one remaining bad mark on my credit. It is an apartment complex 3 years ago that applied tons of fees after I had moved out. I didn't handle the situation ideally (see: ignored it) and it's far too late now to challenge the validity of the amount. I am not able to rent an apartment with this item. The total amount is 2600, but they have offered to settle for 50%. I do not have this amount in a lump sum and wondered if taking out a loan to pay the collection all at once and then pay off the loan in a couple months would be a good idea. The issue is that with my credit I have been declined for a small loan at larger lending institutions. I have a reliable income and my score is on the rise. What would be my best option in this situation? Thank you!!","sentiment":"positive"}

{"selftext":"My friend and I are discussing asset allocation and modern portfolio theory and cannot come to an agreement about how much to invest in Bonds in our 401K.   \n\nTypical recommendations are to put your age in bonds.   I am 28 years old, and have been investing in my company\u2019s 401K for the past 6 years.  I\u2019ve always invested in 100% Stocks with the expectation of retiring in roughly 35-40 years (60-65yo).

I plan to start slowly switching over to bonds when I turn 35, and working them gradually up as I get closer to retirement age.\n\nAs an Engineer with an MBA, I have seen the equations for calculating risk among a diversified portfolio (which makes a lot of sense), but I haven\u2019t seen any math to support early investment in Bonds.   My portfolio is already diversified with a balance of total market, large cap, med cap, small cap, REIT, and international low cost index funds.

And not just any pilot but a Helicopter Pilot at that (it costs about 2x as much to train to be a helo pilot). Military didn\u2019t seem right up my alley and when Wells Fargo said all I had to do was sign the line I was hooked.  \n\nI have approximately $165,000 in student loan debt. This breaks down to about $24,000 through federal aid, $20,000 through a private loan and a few loans totaling to $120,000 from Wells Fargo. \nMy parents cosigned the loans for me and I will not let them suffer for my naive mistake.\n\nMy dad just called me and told me that he received a letter that said my grace period was almost up and on December 6 I needed to make a payment of $1,400 just to Wells Fargo, and that scared the crap out of me. I don\u2019t have any flying jobs coming up (I\u2019m a low time pilot, pretty much the only job available to me is instructing students how to fly) currently I work for my grandpas roofing company and on a great week I make $500. \n\nSo I\u2019m here asking for some opinions on what you guys think my best options are and what loan forgiveness programs might be available to me. \n\nStick with it:\nI love flying I really do I just don\u2019t see how it\u2019s economically viable. As an instructor I would only maybe make 20k a year (not salary). With a 1,400 bill all of my money, and then some, would go to the loan. \n\tThis is all assuming I can get a job. I finished my training 3 months ago and have seen 4 job postings. The first one told me I weighed too much*, the second one never responded to me, and I just applied to the 3rd and 4th ones an hour ago.\n   \n*Our training helicopters don\u2019t have a lot of power, a lot of flight schools require there instructors to be at 180 pound flight weight (flight uniform, headset, maps, sunglasses etc.), it\u2019s taken me 3 months to go from 193 pounds to 183,  I am 6\u2019 5\u201d tall with  5% body fat there\u2019s not much more weight I can lose healthily. Once I get enough hours to move out of instruction (this should take 2-3 years depending on how busy the school is) then I can get to a more healthy weight.  \n\nMilitary: Where I am already a pilot I would have a good chance getting into their program (well according to the recruiters anyway). However, this would require a six year commitment and military pilots don\u2019t really fly that much. I know a guy who\u2019s been in for 6 years and only has 700 hours, compared to my head instructor who\u2019s been flying for 8 years and has 3,000 hours. If I could stick with the civilian side of things I would have enough hours to get a good job.  \n\n\nChange Careers:\nHonestly I don\u2019t know what career I would choose to go into.

I do have one thing holding me back.  At this time, I have approximately $50,000 worth of credit card debt. Yes, you read that right, $50k, with interest rates ranging from around 17% all the way up to 27%.  The debt is spread across 10 cards, with balances ranging from a few hundred dollars all the way up to around $8500.  I have recently refinanced my car.  I owe about $5400 on that, and my payments are $120 a month.  I do have a credit card with the same bank that the auto loan is with.  I also owe a payment of approx $600 a month to my ex wife for a loan that she took out (when things were still good) to pay down some of the credit card debt at a lower interest.  Up until this month, I've been making all my minimum payments, but had to skip 3 this month due to simply not having the funds to pay everything.  My net pay monthly is about $2000-3000, depending on how much overtime I get. I've been averaging about $2500 a month for the last several months, but I am expecting OT to be cut back in mid November. I have very few assetts other than a few hundred dollars cash, my vehicle, and my home.  The home is a sticky situation.

About two years ago I was notified by the state I was convicted in that they were able to charge 12 percent interest, or as I understand it 1 percent per month compounding, on any outstanding debt to the state. I'm currently paying between $300 and $500 per month towards this debt, and the grand total is about $300k. This means I throw money in every month and they add $3,000 or so every month.

My credit is rebounding after a car loan was paid off and it went down hill, but I'd happily sacrifice it for a way out.\n\nI don't have any savings because I'm basically paying a maxed out Roth IRA contribution to restitution every month, and even with no car payment, health insurance, and pretty limited monthly bills other than rent, phone bill, and car insurance I'm kind of scraping by.\n\nI recently picked up another job that earns me maybe $800 a month before taxes, and I'd like to do something smart with that money so when I'm no longer able to work I'll at least have something.\n\nThis debt will not go away in my lifetime without a huge increase in income, and I'm not willing to accrue more debt for school, especially since a felony is pretty prohibitive for a lot of careers.

He sent a bogus .pdf file (which she then forwarded to me) that had what looked like a copy\/pasted logo on it and had 3 errors in her address: specified apartment #115 at our primary residence (which is our single family home), spelled Cincinnati as \"CHINCHINATI\", and had an incorrect\/old zipcode not applicable to our current street address. The zipcode was for an apartment (not #115 interestingly enough) that we lived in prior to buying our first house which makes me think they just cobbled together personal information from different sources).\n\nAfter directing her to hang up immediately, I called the number on the .pdf. I was received pretty rudely when they couldn't find a file that was tied the the number I was calling from (obviously - I was calling about my wife). I requested to speak to the individual who my wife spoke with, and then a separate individual that was specified on the .pdf. I was not transferred, and \"Mark\" decided he would like to help me. I told him he probably didn't want to take my call, because it wasn't going to be a fun one for him. He stayed on the line.\n\nAfter telling him that he was never to call my wife again, I provided her phone number so he could pull her file to delete her record from whatever system or list they bought (or hacked) from this creditor, and told him that I was going to be reporting them to the Attorney General for illegal collection practices, the FTC, and CFPA. He became very aggravated and told me that this was perfectly legal and that she had to pay this debt by next Friday because they bought it from the creditor. He was saying that I was being very argumentative and he couldn't work with me on anything. After a few minutes of telling him that he needed to remove my wife's file from his system, I heard him say he would and I hung up.\n\nI've attached the .pdf that was emailed to us, and I would just like this to reach someone out there that maybe one day receives a similar phone call. YOU CANNOT BE ARRESTED FOR BEING DELINQUENT OR NOT PAYING A DEBT. If they threaten you in any way with imprisonment, they are scammers. You can be sued, yes, but they cannot 'send the cops in the next 30 minutes' for you. Do a quick google search on whoever the caller says they are calling from and read up on scammers. \n\nHere is a good place to start: https:\/\/www.consumer.ftc.gov\/articles\/0258-fake-debt-collectors\n\nStay safe out there, and keep cool and calm when on the phone with these guys. Use common sense and if they start throwing out a bunch of personal information to make you think, 'only a real creditor\/collector could have that info', remember: everything is for sale.\n","sentiment":"positive"}
{"selftext":"I'm 24 from a very wealthy family from a small town in North East England and today my IVA has been approved.\n\nAs a fresh faced 18 year old I embarked upon the exciting adventure of breaking out and going to University in a city a few hours away from home. Long story short; my naivety and stupidity lead me into spiraling drug addiction. I went FULLY off the rails, I nearly failed university, I had no partner and actively lied to my parants in order for them to send me money. I was honestly scum.\n\nMyself and my older 'best friend' (28) took out a credit card in my name of \u00a35,500 and blew it over the course of 4 months alongside my student loan and wages from part time work. We burnt out and then I met my partner - who I chose over the drugs. (2 years clean) We decided to move up north to get me away from the scene and I kept my debt a secret and burying my head in the sand.\n\nI was young and idiotic and paid the minimum each month which was okay before my interest free period ended. It got to the point I took out additional credit cards to pay off interest charges and ran my credit into the ground - all out of idiocy, pride and lack of understanding. I became depressed and in a constant state of anxiety - my sleep reduced to 5 hours a night. I also started suffering severe panic attacks. I paid all my monthly debts off on time but it came to the point I couldn't keep my head afloat anymore. My budgeting had been so tight it has been down to the penny and been paying any disposable income in to help alleviate some debt.\n\n\u00a310,000 total debt at age 24 I felt pathetic and disappointing and is the result of 462826372 bad desicions.\n\nI discussed hypothetical situations my Dad who basically offered to bail me out but I really really couldn't ask for or accept the help. I feel I needed to take responsibility for the poor financial choices that I had made. If I didn't do this my attitude to money wouldn't change and I ran the risk of not learning my lesson.\nTwo weeks ago I began texting a company to seek advice and finally had the courage to say it out loud.\nI AM IN DEBT - I NEED HELP.\n\nI have told my partner - who was as wonderful, kind and amazing as ever and last night I received approval of my IVA. It took two phone calls to organise and a bit of WhatsApping with helpful non-judgemental advisors. Not an advert, I promise!\n\nLast night is the first proper nights sleep I had in years. Honestly it is a weight lifted and I feel this will change my quality of life and mental health. My ultimate goal is a family. So my upwards swing begins. \n \nAfter knuckling down at work and getting a promotion this month will be the first wage I have ever had that gives me a positive bank balance and a positive outlook on my future. \n\nI found this surprisingly therapeutic and for reading this far; I thank you. \n\nFeel free to share your experiences it would be nice to speak to people who can empathise with the relief!\n","sentiment":"negative"}

{"selftext":"Currently have a $312k home loan at 5% 30yr fixed. Have about $25k in CC debt, most at 5% but about $8k left at 15%. I recently sold some bitcoin to pay off the majority of the 15% that I did have, so this is what is left in debt. \n\nCost of the refinance is around $3000 in closing and $875 in appraisal. I am told from the loan officer that I will lower my monthly around $250 if I just refinance from 5% to around 4.25%. I am not going to pay this property off ever, fairly sure we would move in the 5-10 year range. I don't think my interest rate would ever get much lower, my credit is ok and raising and my job situation is stable and good income but that seems fairly low and doubt the future holds lower. \n\nI do have some more crypto I would consider selling to pay off the 15% cards (and then use the remaining monthly budget surplus to pay off the 5% cards). Not sure I want to part with more as the future looks bright but I want to get that 15% debt gone. \n\nLikely I can take out another $10-20k in the house if I wanted. I am torn, the figures seem close in terms of what it is going to cost me to refi and how much I owe in debt. If I just save that $3800 and put it towards debt it might be better. Of course I'd rather have mortgage interest than credit card. \n\nI do also have another $20k in CC debit as business (but under my name personally) that I would eventually like to get paid down but I Need to talk to my accountant as to the best benefit of that. I'd rather the business be paying interest than me personally so I'll pay off all the personal debt first, for sure. But if I can get all debt paid off I would love to start doing some actual saving. \n\nI know the crypto is the unknown here. If it is more advantageous to hold or not, but I just consider it any other asset and if I want to sell some now to pay off debt or hold. It has been HIGHLY advantageous to own and buy the crypto over paying off the debt so far given the position I was in with debt over the last few years and the gains off the crypto. So unlike stocks or precious metals the market is very ripe for crazy gains but also very volatile. I've done good buying low and selling high, only generally selling to pay off this debt. I feel like the amount I would sell now to pay off the 15% debt is small compared to the gains crypto will make in general and I still have enough that it would be as life changing with huge gains that I hope will come even selling some now. \n\n\nAny thoughts or advice? \n","sentiment":"negative"}

I started getting into entrepreneurial journeys researching up on creating e-commerce sites, affiliate marketing etc which is now implanted in my brain of why I'm I wasting time and energy into a 9-5 that I honestly don't care about or want to do. Fast forward a few months I pretty much got myself fired from work having plans of moving back to AK in a small town with no new opportunities or really any opportunities for myself in hope of being able to pay off all bills and debt and be able to save a money in hopes of learning something to work for me. Well, it didn't go as planned and before I move back to AK  I ended up turning in my car because I could no longer make payments. Fell behind on my credit card etc and pretty much now have landed myself in about $10,000 in debt. Which to me really much but just stressful to have because of dumb decisions I made. Half the debt is from turning in my car and owing on that (I know not very smart choices at all, but I literally don't have anyone to help guide me in the right direction.. And I usually learn as I make mistakes) I'm currently living in AK with my brother now and I can throw chunks of $300 at these debts every two weeks my thing is I really want to move back to AZ and get my life back on track as quickly as possible. I don't know whether to pay minimum payments on these debts and save money or pay chunks and save money afterwards.

I asked the dealer finance guy \u201chey, can we do this with my wife also on the loan, so it simplifies the autopay, and we don\u2019t have a dormant savings account as a result of all this?\u201d  The finance guy explained that since the title paperwork was already submitted to the dept of licensing, and the name on the title had to match the name on the loan, there\u2019s nothing we can do: I have to have the loan and title in my name only (wife didn\u2019t come with me to bank\/dealer because she was home watching the kids).\n\nSo, is this accurate?

{"selftext":"Hi everyone, I wanted to get some advice here, because I've been told some things recently that I'm not sure if true, I figured people in here would be pretty knowledgeable.  \nSo, I've worked hard over the last couple of years to improve my credit score, going from sub-500 to 683 currently. My income is up and my debt is down and we even just got pre-qualified for a mortgage, which is relieving because at 47 and with kids, I've been a renter all this time and thought I'd never get to this point.  \nAnyway, we are thinking about waiting. We only just renewed our lease, and with some other things going on, it seems buying and moving would be better done around May of next year. Our current pre-qual expires in December, so we'd have to run another one in the spring. My brother-in-law just told my wife that this is a bad idea: he said that the hard inquiry on this pre-qual will drop my credit score by 70-80 points and we won't qualify when we try again in the spring.  \nThis seems extreme to me - I expected maybe a 15 point drop or thereabouts. Actually, it's been just over a month and my FICO score dropped by only 4 points (from 687 to 683) per the FICO score reporting feature in my bank account.  \nSo I disagreed with him, but my wife things he may be right - and wants to follow his advice and rush to buy a house now. Which is it?  \n  \nAlso, I've been thinking of refinancing my auto loan. My debt\/income ratio is in a favorable range so it's not something that *has* to be done, but I can lower my interest rate significantly now that we have a credit union account, and lower my payment by about $100\/month.

I'll start at the beginning, My father passed away when I was a freshman in college and I was rowing for my university with the \"verbal promise\" of receiving more scholarship funds to offset the cost of the college. I made the stupid decision of staying home and attending a private college to stay close with my father during his ailments. \n\nI would frequently receive financial \"Awards\" via my college and the US Gov't that I would not cash\/deposit into my account as I was able to cover my costs with the assistance from my father's passing. \n\nSo let's say on average I was receiving anywhere from $2400 a semester to a certain semester I was as high as $8700. Low estimates by me say this could have been up to $35,000 in unchashed\/deposited \"awards\" by the end of my masters. I informed my school at the time that I did not need these and they told me to not cash them and I wouldn't be charged if I sent them back to the US Gov't to which I sent them all back. \n\nSo after 4 years plus 2 for Masters, I came out with about $87k in student loan debt at 6% interest and another $50k in Parent plus loan debt. I've been paying this for 3 years and recently bumped up my payment to $1500 per month from 1,000 in Yr1, and 1,200 in Yr2, on average doing 425 on interest and maybe the rest to principal.\n\nI've attempted to contact the US Gov't for assistance to track the check amount that I did not cash as my college (Private college, NY) closed and has no means of communication or tracking of the checks that were never cashed. The US Gov't tells me to call my state to see if they have the financial records of the school and the state tells me that the US Gov't shouldn't have given me the states number as the state is not in charge of loans.\n\n Now if I had known that the checks should have been cashed and that I was going to have to pay them back anyway, life would have been significantly easier a few years ago but since I did not cash them, I was wondering if anyone is a student loan wiz to assist me in any way possible to potentially track some organization down that would be able to look into the checks that were never cashed and take that balance out of my remaining principal? \n\nIf i'm up the creek without a paddle, that's fine but if anyone can think of anything that would be great.

I make about $1800 a month. I had $5,2000 in grants for tuition (which has already been applied towards my tuition) and I apply for multiple scholarships every week. I am currently in the process of getting Washington residency which will cut my tuition from $1,000 a month to $200 a month. I am hoping to get approved in less than three months. If I am not approved I will have to drop out of my uni. I do have my AA, thank god. (Go community college!) Unfortunately, I did have to take a class as out of state this term in order to qualify for deferment. If I don't get instate, I might be able to defer my enrollment at my uni and wait until it has been approved. Worse case is I can't go back to UW until I am 23, because I will be considered financially independent from my parents. I would have to reapply to the UW and theres a huge chance I won't get back in... I absolutely don't want to put my college education on hold as it means everything to me. I have not taken out any loans this year, and I am avoiding all loans if I can. \n\n\nRent: $625 \n\nUtilities: $60\n\nTuition: $850-$1000 a month \n\nPhone: $40\n\nGroceries: $150 \n\nDoc Appt copays\/meds: $100 \n\nSpotify: $5\n\n(I live with my partner and he helps with some of the costs as he is a recent college graduate with no debt, but I will be responsible for my own finances and he has his own bills to pay.)\n\n\nI am still on my parent's health insurance until the divorce is finalized this year, and then I will be applying for Washington State Apple Health Care. I currently have All Savers, but I am in-network with United Health Care Choice Plus. I have met my in-network deductible for this year, so I am praying I have no more health issues or costs. \n\n\nMy EOB's were going to my parents' house so I called this week to have every statement from this year be sent to me. I have resubmitted Medical Debt #1 and #3 to insurance as I believe it was done incorrectly. They noticed they charged me out-of-network when my doctors were in network. I am hoping this brings the costs down. \n\n\nIn the mean time, the debt collectors will not leave me alone for my medical debt. #1 and #3 have 90 day holds on them because of being resubmit to insurance. I told debt #2 I could not afford the payment plan and they berated me. I told them I was a full-time student and had no spare income to go towards the debt. They said they would take my grants or income wages away. Is this possible?\n\n\nMy questions are as follows:\n\n1. What are my options for getting my medical debt lowered? On better payment plans? Do I have to pay the interest on them? What if I refused to pay the interest? Two of the debts are from hospitals. Can I still go to those hospitals and ask that they cut the bill in half? Any advice on handling debt collectors and lowering these health bill costs is greatly appreciated. \n\n\n2. Does anyone have ANY tactics or tricks to triple checking my insurance statements and having free resources for health care? I have health insurance and I still can't afford health care. I feel very depressed and hopeless.\n\n\n3. I am financially independent from my parents besides the fact that I am on their health insurance. Is there anything else I might qualify for in terms of free resources or welfare? \n\n\n4. What are my rights when it comes to debt collectors in WA? I know I can ask them to cease contact with me in writing, they can only call a few times a week and during certain times, they can only garnish wages with a court order, and I don't have to give them my info if I don't want to. And, I should ask them for proof of debt and how it's tied to me. Does this all sound correct?\n\n\n5. Lastly, my plan right now is just to avoid the debt until I can pay it off. I obviously can't even touch my student loan, not even my interest. Is this smart? What is the best thing to do? Drop out of school to pay off these debts? Or ignore the debts and push through school and hope I get instate? My credit score is 770s right now, so I really don't want this medical debt to effect that. \n\n\nAny and all advice is appreciated. Besides telling me to move back in with my parents or move back to that state... It is not possible in the slightest.

{"selftext":"Hi,\nI recently opened a college checking account with Chase. I primarily bank with NFCU, but I decided to open this account up as well. I primarily use this Chase account to deposit money earned from my credit card's cash back rewards as sort of freebie spending money.\n\n-\nToday I went to pay something with my debit card and my card was declined. I checked my account and saw that my balance was $0.00 due to an ambiguous pending transaction \"W\/D TO ANOTHER ACCT\". I called up Chase to ask them about it. The representative stated that I had another account open (my high school checking account that my mom opened for me when I was 15 that I'd since forgotten about) that was recently closed due to insufficient funds. The account has a negative balance of around $800. They said that this account is in their collections department now and that they would continue to remove funds from my account in order to pay off that balance.\n\n-\nI was very surprised by this because I have had a credit card through Chase for about two years now that I have always paid off in full, and I have never once heard about this. Even when I went in to open the new account, this was never mentioned at all.\n\n-\nI've already texted my mom and am waiting to hear back from her about this, but honestly, I am not surprised. My mom used this account as her primary checking account, and at the time she was not very financially sound or responsible. I do not believe that she did this maliciously, or that she has stolen my identity as the account was opened with my knowledge with both of us as co-owners.\n\n-\nI informed the representative that I was a minor at the time that this account was created, but she said I am still liable to pay because I am a joint owner of the (now closed) account. I asked them to send me a letter with all of the information in it, but I guess my main question is am I liable to pay this balance? My school has a free legal counseling service that I could look into. Should I speak to a lawyer about this, or this is a cut and dry situation where I just have to pay? Thank you.\n\n-\nTLDR: Mom opened high school checking account with me as a co-owner when I was 15. The account recently closed because it was overdrawn by $800, and now Chase has begun to remove funds from my new checking account. What steps do I take?","sentiment":"negative"}
{"selftext":"Hey guys,\n\nI'm 24 and I've got student loans in my name and in my parent's names'. The agreement before I went to college was that I would pay them off with no help from my parents. Like a lot of people I was pretty financially illiterate while in college and for the first year after, so I just put my parents loans into forbearance and started making minimum payments on mine. \nSince a little over a year ago I started taking my finances seriously and have been paying down my loans very aggressively. At my continued rate I think I'll get them done in about two years. However, it has now come time to make a decision regarding my parent's loans. Do I put them into forbearance\/deferral or begin paying them?\n\nMy thought about this is that if they or I die the loans are discharged, so is it a better financial decision to pay mine off first because of this? I of course don't want my parents to die, but I'm trying to wrap my ahead around why this would be a bad idea other than more interest gained on the loans\n\nIs there a better plan? Any advice would be appreciated.\n\nEdit: also worth noting is that while my parents make over six figures combined, they are always poor because of prior bad financial decisions. I've tried to help change this a little, but you know the whole \"lead a horse to water\" deal. So if I don't pay them, these loans aren't getting paid.","sentiment":"negative"}

{"selftext":"For the past 11 months I ran a self-experiment where I first went from using only cash whenever possible (and debit online), to always using credit cards (and paying them off in full).  Using YNAB, I tracked all my spending and planned out a budget every month before that month began.  The result:\n\nThrough credit cards, I earned $395.23 in 2-5% cash back but also spent 19% more overall compared to cash (resulting in a loss).  The biggest differences were:\n\n* **Pain vs. Pleasure.**  Whenever I used a credit card, because a part of me would think about cash back, it was fun.  Even though I was buying something, it felt like I was getting free money.  Yet because that feeling simply did not exist when using cash, purchases felt more like total losses and uncomfortable.\n\n* **Convenience.**  The credit cards were undoubtedly easier to use so I spent more on food delivery (mostly UberEATS) and at vending machines.  Surprisingly, simply not wanting to get cash from an ATM was enough to prevent me from getting delivery, and not wanting loose change stopped me from using vending machines.\n\n* **Restaurants.**  Similar to the first point, because I knew I was going to be using cash I was more mindful of the cost.  The cash was in my wallet and I didn't want it to leave.  And yet due to that almost subconscious part of me that would think about free money with credit cards, I was simply more likely to feel \"this is fun\" and order based on emotion.\n\nWhile I am well aware that my self-experiment is not at all scientific (there could be other reasons why I spent more on credit), I am surprised at the result because I've been budgeting and using credit cards for years.  I have consistently had $150 budgeted every month for restaurants for example, and while with credit cards I would think, \"I still have $X left to spend,\" with cash I just didn't want to.\n\nIt's incredible how subtle and yet powerful the lure to use credit cards can be.  I suppose I could just have better self-control, but I have zero debt, live below my means, and did this experiment for almost a year, so I think I have pretty good self-control anyway. \n\nA part of me wants to stop using credit cards completely, but because credit scores are still important and debit cards aren't as safe as credit cards (or so I think), I'm not sure that's the best idea.  Maybe I should just use credit cards for automatic withdrawals and online purchases and cash for everything else.\n\nFood for thought.","sentiment":"negative"}

Should he invest in his company's 403b as well?\nWhat type of savings should I have for myself? \nWhat type of savings should we have for our 1 y\/o and soon to be newborn? 529 vs. Roth IRA vs. S&amp;P 500 etf ?\n","sentiment":"positive"}
{"selftext":"Long time lurker, first time poster.\n\nTitle says all. Wife got a call from collections, but I'm almost 100% sure we already paid this bill.\n\nThe amount is for ~$220 for a medical office visit back in 2015. I have the bill as we try to keep all of these records. Since that visit, however, I have switched banks and the insurance has changed their HSA provider. I have no access to any sort of records indicating whether or not this bill was paid. I can log on to my previous credit union of 15+ years, but for who knows what reason, they show absolutely no transactions prior to 2016...\n\nI've recorded my phone call with the collection agency (one-party consent, they are based in the same state), and plan to send a debt validation letter, but I would like some further advice on how to proceed with this.","sentiment":"negative"}
{"selftext":"So I work in the oilfield and starting today I\u2019m going to do a 35-7 schedule meaning work 35 17 hour shifts and take 7 days off to save and pay off my debt. I have about 4 credit cards about 1500 each and 2 loans out for furniture. Conns balance is like 3000 and ashleys is about 1500. So I was wondering should I pay off the biggest balance off first or the ones with the highest monthly payments? Me working this schedule I should take home about 13,000 but minus bills I should have about 8k left. Also i plan on paying off my wife\u2019s car since she only owes 2900 and that payment would save us 350 a month. Thanks in advance. ","sentiment":"negative"}
{"selftext":"I had a job that helped me pay my credit card bills until a few months ago. I have food and shelter via my husband, but nothing more. I have six credit cards that add up to $25k with varying APRs (8% - 20%).\n\nMy husband and I rent a home, while my children live in our house (about $360k left to pay on the mortgage, and FWIW, Zillow lists it as a $550k home - our children make the payments).\n\nOnly my name is on the credit cards, but both of our names are on the house documents\/mortgage.\n\nI'm wondering what options I have if finding a job is not within reach. I think my children would be willing to help me pay this debt, but I don't think I'd feel comfortable with this. Bankruptcy was never in my plans, but it's preferable than having my kids pay off this debt for years ($450\/month toward principal).\n\nMy husband still works, but he has an $8k debt to credit cards himself. He was going to takeover my own debt, but that can't certainly be a good thing when he's a year or two from retiring with full benefits.\n\nThank you for any insight.","sentiment":"negative"}
{"selftext":"Two weekends ago, my wife got a notification from credit karma that there were several new hard inquiries on her credit report. I immediately pulled her full free credit report and initiated credit freezes for all 3 bureaus (I know I should have done it weeks ago, but things have been a little crazy).\n\nThere were 3 hard pulls at the time all for credit cards. 2 of them were places she already has cards. I called all 3 companies and explained that situation  and they said they'll take care of it and not to worry. \n\nHowever, today we got a letter form bank of America (not one of those original 3 ccs) that said a line of credit was being opened but they couldnt proceed until we called in to verify some info. This line of credit seems to have been initiated 2-3 days after I had already put the credit freeze on for her.\n\nThe last piece of important information is that when I pulled her free credit report, the new lines of credit were all registered to the same apartment in north Florida.\n\nI'd really like to know if there's anything I should still do to protect her further and what other steps I should take.","sentiment":"negative"}
